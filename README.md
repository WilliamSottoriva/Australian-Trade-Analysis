# Australian-Trade-Analysis

This report outlines the key information and trends found in Australian Trade over the 1988-2023 period. We
analyse the relevant data in the 2024-Spring-Ass3-V15.xlsx dataset and develop statistical and analytical patterns
to reveal important insights. By effectively graphing the data, we outline key findings, trends and
recommendations for main categories, subcategories and their relationships between each other. This includes
the strong growth of Australiaâ€™s economy while remaining relatively rudimentary.
